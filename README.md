Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month.  
A loop should then prompt for each expense for the month and keep a running total.  
Think: What value should you tell the user to enter to finish entering expenses?  
When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or under budget.
