Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for a month.
A loop should then prompt for each expense for the month and keep a running total.
Think: What value should you tell the user to enter to finish entering expenses?
When the loop finishes, the program should display the amount that the user is over or under budget.

Start with a sample run of what the program will look like as comments.

SAMPLE RUN 1
Budget for a month USD: 1000.00
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: q
EXPENSES: $0.00
BUDGET: $1000.00
BALANCE: $1000.00

SAMPLE RUN 2
Budget for a month USD: 1000.00
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 10
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 105
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 42
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 7
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: q
EXPENSES: $164.00
BUDGET: $1000.00
BALANCE: $836.00

SAMPLE RUN 3
Budget for a month USD: 1000.00
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 10
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 105
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 42
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 7
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: 2000
Add expense USD [Q/q to quit]: q
EXPENSES: $2164.00
BUDGET: $1000.00
BALANCE: $(-1164.00)

Next, write your program in pseudocode as comments.

Lastly, write Python code.

Run and test!

Post a link to your code.

Kudos for clever code or enhancements.
